- .mp3
- .mp4
- .wma
- .wav
- .ogg

## Regular Expressions Used

1. `regex_web_name`: Matches annoying website names surrounded by parentheses, brackets, or curly braces.
2. `regex_num_start`: Matches numbers at the beginning of the file name, possibly followed by a dot or hyphen.

## Improvements Made

- Fixed the issue with `exit` by calling it as a function (`exit()`).
- Replaced `WindowsError` with `OSError` for better cross-platform compatibility.
- Used `os.path.join` to create file paths.
- Used `os.listdir` and `os.path.isfile` for listing files and checking if a path is a file.
- Changed the function to return early if the folder is not found.

Feel free to use and modify the script according to your needs!
